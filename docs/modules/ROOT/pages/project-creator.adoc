= Project Creator Guide

:description: This guide shows you how to create projects using the CLC `project create` command.

{description}

== Introduction

Hazelcast CLC provides a solution that simplifies the creation of Hazelcast projects. The created projects do not require further configuration.

You can find the templates in the https://github.com/hazelcast-templates[Hazelcast Templates GitHub Account^].

== Create a Cloud Cluster

For this guide, let's create a Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Cluster. First, sign in to the link:https://cloud.hazelcast.com[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank], and follow the xref:get-started.adoc[Get Started with the Hazelcast CLC] tutorial.

== Create Your First Project with Default Hazelcast Templates

Before creating a project, list the available templates using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
clc template list
----

When you create a project, the template is stored in `$CLC_HOME/templates` directory. To list only the templates stored in your local environment, add the `--local` flag to the `template list` command.

To fetch the latest updates from repositories, add the `--refresh` flag to the command.

NOTE: These flags are mutually exclusive, which means that you can only use one of them in a command.

Let's create our first project by using link:https://github.com/hazelcast-templates/go-client-getting-started[go-client-getting-startedˆ] template. This template includes the following extension files:

```
go-client-getting-started
├── README.md.keep
├── config.go.template
└── ...
```

The `.template` extension specifies that the file is a link:https://pkg.go.dev/text/template[Go template^] that includes placeholders and actions. The `.keep` extension identifies files to keep as they are required for the project. For example, a file named _README.md_ in the template is replaced by a file named _README.md.keep_ when the project is created.

Let's look a bit deeper to _config.go.template_ to see what placeholders are included:

* config
* cluster_name
* cluster_discovery_token
* cluster_address
* ssl_key_path
* ssl_cert_path
* ssl_key_password
* cluster_api_base

that are used in this template. You can find a full list of placeholders in the link:clc-project.adoc[clc project] topic.

To create a project, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
clc -c <your-config> project create go-client-getting-started
----

This project is created in the current working directory. To create the project in a different directory, add the --output-dir flag to the command. Once created, the project can be run immediately as the placeholders are already configured.

== Create and Use User-created Templates

If preferred, you can use templates that you have created. When creating your templates, keep the following points in mind:

* Use the format used in the link:https://pkg.go.dev/text/template[Go template].
* To add default values, create a _template.yaml_ file, add a `defaults` node, and save it in the template root directory.
* Template files must have the _.template_ extension.
* File names that start with a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`) are ignored, unless they also have a _.keep_ extensions.
* Any files with a _.keep_ extension are copied to the project with the _.keep_ extension removed. All other files are copied without changes.
*Properties are read from the following resources in order:

.. The defaults node of the templates.yaml file.
+
NOTE: The keys must not contain any punctuation characters.

.. `config.yaml`

.. User passed key-values in the "KEY=VALUE" format.
+
NOTE: The keys must contain only lowercase, numerical, and underscore characters.

After creating your template, push it to a GitHub repository that resides in a separate organization. Hazelcast recommends creating an account/organization specifically for your templates.1

To list your templates, use the `template list` command with `--source` flag:

[source,bash]
----
clc template list --source=<your-organization-name>
----

To create a project from your template, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
clc -c <your-config> project create <your-template> --source=<your-organization-name>
----

You can also use placeholders in your template, which can be passed using the `create` command as follows:

[source,bash]
----
clc -c <your-config> project create <your-template> foo=bar --source=<your-organization-name>
----

In the example above, the `foo` placeholder will be replaced with `bar` on project creation.

== Conclusion

In this guide you saw how to use default Hazelcast templates, and how to create and use your own templates, when creating projects.

The project creator provides a straightforward way to create ready-to-use projects using a single command.
